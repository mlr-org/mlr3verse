# mlr3verse 0.2.2

- Updated reexports.

# mlr3verse 0.2.1

* Updated reexports.

# mlr3verse 0.2.0

* Instead of depending on mlr3 packages, all packages are now imported.
  All functions and objects required to do data analysis are re-exported, while
  functions and objects required to **extend** the packages are not exported.
  This change aims to provide a thin view on the most important functions of the
  mlr3 ecosystem and thereby aid beginners to get started.
* If the `mlr3extralearners` (<https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3extralearners>)
  package is installed, it will automatically be loaded and learner dictionary
  will automatically get populated.
